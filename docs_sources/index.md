#EvoBic

EvoBic is a next-generation biclustering algorithm based on artificial intelligence (AI).
EvoBic is probably the first algorithm capable of discovering the most challenging patterns (i.e. row-constant, column-constant, shift, scale, shift-scale and trend-preserving)
It is also one of the very few parallel biclustering algorithms that use at least one graphics processing unit (GPU) and is ready for big-data challenges.

EvoBic is mainly implemented in C++11. CUDA with OpenMP used for parallelization.
